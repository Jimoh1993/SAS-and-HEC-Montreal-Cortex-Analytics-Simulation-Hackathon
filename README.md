The detailed description is in pdf Hachathon materials folder.

The predictive model we created uses decision tree and random forest machine learnin predictive agorithms to predict the chance of donation before and after contact. And we use multiple linear regression to predict the donation amount. The detailed model is in [Cortex SAS](https://www.sas.com/fr_ch/training/programs/cortex-analytics-simulation-game.html).
